Things to do for project notable (desktop app):

- Code optimisation; remove duplicated code and think about other solutions for those

Notes:

- If note input fields have been filled with values, they will be cleared if you choose to add a notebook and pressing the button. Solution; put the field.clear() methods in the if-statements
